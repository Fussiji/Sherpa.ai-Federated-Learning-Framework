    This class uses a simple mechanism to add randomness for binary data. This algorithm is described

    1.- Flip a coin

    2.- If tails, then respond truthfully.

    3.- If heads, then flip a second coin and respond "Yes" if heads and "No" if tails.

    # Arguments
        prob_head_first: float in [0,1] representing probability to use a random response instead of true value.
            This is equivalent to prob_head of the first coin flip algorithm described by Dwork.
        prob_head_second: float in [0,1] representing probability of respond true when random answer is provided.
            Equivalent to prob_head in the second coin flip in the algorithm.

class LaplaceMechanism(DifferentialPrivacyMechanism):
    """
    Implements the laplace mechanism for differential privacy defined by Dwork in their work
    "The algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy".

    Notice that the Laplace mechanism is a randomization algorithm that depends on the sensitivity,
    which can be regarded as a numeric query. One can show that this mechanism is
    epsilon-differentially private with epsilon = sensitivity/b where b is a constant.

    In order to apply this mechanism for a particular value of epsilon, we need to compute
    the sensitivity, which might be hard to compute in practice. The framework provides
    a method to estimate the sensitivity of a query that maps the private data in a normed space
    (see: [SensitivitySampler](../Sensitivity Sampler))

    # Arguments:
        sensitivity: float representing sensitivity of the applied query
        epsilon: float for the epsilon you want to apply
