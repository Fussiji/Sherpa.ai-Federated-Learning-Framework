    3.- If heads, then flip a second coin and respond "Yes" if heads and "No" if tails.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _prob_head_first : float
        Probability to use a random response instead of true value. This is equivalent to prob_head of the first coin
        flip algorithm described by Dwork.
    _prob_head_second : float
        Probability of respond true when random answer is provided. Equivalent to prob_head in the second coin flip
        in the algorithm.
