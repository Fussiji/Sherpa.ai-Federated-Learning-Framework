    "   \n",
    "   1.3. *Concept shift*: when the data features with the same label differs accross different clients (same features, different label), i.e. due to cultural differences or when label from data with the same features differs accross different clients (same label, different features), i.e. due to personal preferences. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   1.4. *Unbalancedness*: it is common that the amount of data varies significantly between clients.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Non-independent client distributions**: when the distribution of data from some clients depend in some way on the distribution of data from another. For example, cross-device FL experiments are performed at night local time which causes a geographic bias in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-identical and non-independent distributions**:  in real FL scenarios, data may be non-IID for several reasons simultaneously due to the particular nature of the data source.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, the options available are the same and have the same meaning as in the I.I.D. sampling. According to the *sampling* parameter, when *sampling = 'whithout_replacement'*, due to non-I.I.D restrcitions (clients with reduced number of known labels), it is possible that some clients receive less data than specified by the weights parameter due to the lack of more data from a certain label. This fact is possible too when *sampling = 'whith_replacement'* but is more unlikely due to we can reuse data of some label. It will only happen if the amount of data assigned for some client is bigger than the total amount of data of these labels.\n",
